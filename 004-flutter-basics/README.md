# Handling the basics in Flutter yourself

In this tutorial we will go through the motions of handling the basics yourself without relying on an architecture. I've seen to many questions on StackOverflow about things that shouldn't be a question if you're using an architecture to build your apps. When you're using an architecture it should be a neccessity and because you've exausted the "pure" implementation. Understand how to implement simply and grow if needed.
